Run code
python plot_digits_classification.py


Quiz 2
create a new branch based on main -- name it feature/importance_of_model_selection
Get train-dev-and-test sett accuracy metrics for all the hyperparameter combinations. -- make sure there are at least 10 combination
Show them in tabular format : columns : train acc, dev acc, test acc
Compute min, max, mean, median of the accuracies obtained in previous step
Also, obtain the best model and best accuracy
Make observations about: 1. variability in the accuracy as the hyperparameters are varied 2. do best test accuracy occur with the hyperparameter that yield best train or dev accuracy?
Bonus: Repeat 1-7 for some other train:dev:test splitting ratios. and see if your observations would change.
